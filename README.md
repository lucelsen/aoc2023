# aoc 2023 in rust

This is my aoc 2023 solution written in Rust.


#### AOC

Please visit the [aoc website](https://adventofcode.com/2023/)
The input files are not part of this repo.


#### Compile and run each day

1. Move the input files to res/dayXX/input.txt
2. Compile: `cargo build --bin dayXX` (optional)
3. Run: `cargo run --bin dayXX`
